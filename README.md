A 3d raycast engine for Arduino

Just experimenting with an Arduino Nano I bought some time ago. This chip is very limited in process and memory.
Probably can be optimized and structured much better. Still learning.
Will try to keep learning and improve it.

Hardware I used:
- Protoboard
- Arduino nano V3
- LCD OLED 128x64
- 4 buttons
- 4 10k ohms resistors

Resources:
- Sprites from https://www.spriters-resource.com
- Much thanks to https://lodev.org/cgtutor for so wonderful resource about raycasting engines

To do:
- Make zbuffer work (half-implemented, but having memory issues)
- Build some basic IA for enemies
- Make possible kill enemies
- Make work picking up medikits and keys
- Doors
- A game over screen
